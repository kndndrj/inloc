Loosely based on code from [this repository](https://github.com/leon73/Python-Base64).

## License

The original source is licensed under `CC0 1.0 Universal`, but I think that I changed the code so
much that it can have it's own license. Therefore, this code is licensed with the license from
[parent repository](../LICENSE).
